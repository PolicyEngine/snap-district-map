## Distribution

**£1.5m threshold (567 constituencies):**

- Top 10% account for 58% of all high-value sales

**Geographic concentration:** London and Home Counties (Surrey, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire)

## Comparison to Policy Estimates

| Metric | FT Estimate | 2024 Sales | Note |
|--------|-------------|------------|------|
| Properties | 145k-300k | 14.6k | Sales = ~5-10% of stock |
| Revenue | £600m | £29m | Stock-based vs sales-based |

## Methodology

1. Load 2024 Land Registry price paid data (881,757 transactions)
2. Filter properties above £1.5m and £2m thresholds
3. Map postcodes to constituencies using ONS NSPL (2.7M postcodes)
4. Calculate statistics by constituency
5. Merge with Census 2021 household counts for % calculations

**Limitation:** Analysis uses 2024 sales (1-2% of housing stock), not total properties. True policy impact would be 10-20x larger.
